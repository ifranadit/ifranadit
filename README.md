Hi, I'm Radit Triawan Ifran 👋

💻 Information Systems Student | Aspiring Web Developer

I am a curious and driven Information Systems student at Universitas Tarumanagara with hands-on experience in full-stack web development. I'm passionate about creatively solving problems and building digital solutions that are functional and user-friendly.

I'm currently seeking a Software Engineering/Web Development Internship to apply my skills in a collaborative, challenging environment.
